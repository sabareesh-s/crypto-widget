# Crypto Widget Readme

## Usage

To add a cryptocurrency widget to your project, simply copy and paste the following script tag into your HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sabareesh-s/crypto-widget/coinGeckoWidget.js" data-token="bitcoin" color-scheme="light"></script>
```

You can find the JavaScript file hosted at this URL: [Crypto Widget JS File](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sabareesh-s/crypto-widget/coinGeckoWidget.js).

Make sure to change the `data-token` attribute to specify the cryptocurrency you want to display.

## Color Schemes

The widget supports three color schemes:

- Dark
- Light
- Auto (default)

The "auto" option automatically adapts to the system color scheme. You can set the color scheme using the `color-scheme` attribute in the script tag.
